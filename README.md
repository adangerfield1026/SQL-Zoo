🆘 Getting Help
Common Issues
"psql: command not found"
→ See Windows_Installation_Guide.md - Step 3: Verify Installation
"password authentication failed"
→ Use the password you set during PostgreSQL installation
"relation does not exist"
→ Make sure you created the tables (see Part 3 of installation guide)
"No data returned from queries"
→ Load the sample data: psql -U postgres -d playstore_db -f load_playstore_data.sql
